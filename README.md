# Mafuriko App 🌊📱

Mafuriko App is an **AI-powered early warning platform** designed to help vulnerable communities prepare for and respond to climate-related disasters such as floods, droughts, and heatwaves.  
The app leverages **weather APIs, machine learning, and mobile messaging (SMS/WhatsApp/USSD)** to deliver **localized, actionable alerts** in real-time.

---

## 🚀 Project Vision
Mafuriko App aims to:
- Enhance **anticipatory action (AA)** frameworks by providing early, hyperlocal alerts.  
- Strengthen the **resilience of women and youth** (target >50% beneficiaries).  
- Enable **data-driven preparedness** for climate shocks and stresses.  
- Support **sustainable livelihoods** through timely, life-saving information.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Backend:** Python (FastAPI) or Node.js  
- **Database:** Supabase / Firebase  
- **AI/ML:** scikit-learn, Hugging Face (for local language translation & AI improvements)  
- **Messaging:** Twilio (SMS/WhatsApp) or integration with local telecoms (USSD/SMS Gateway)  
- **Hosting:** Railway.app / Render / Vercel  

---

## 📦 Features (MVP)
- Fetch weather/climate data from **OpenWeather API** and/or **local met agencies**.  
- Apply simple **rules-based logic** (e.g., rainfall > 50mm = flood risk).  
- Generate **localized alerts** in community languages.  
- Deliver alerts through **SMS/WhatsApp/USSD**.  
- Collect **community feedback** to improve accuracy.

3. **Month 3 – Pilot Launch**  
   - Register 50–100 users in one community.  
   - Send daily weather updates + test urgent alerts.  

4. **Months 4–5 – Iteration**  
   - Introduce AI models for improved predictions.  
   - Expand alert languages, add feedback loops.  

5. **Month 6 – Demo & Impact Evaluation**  
   - Measure accuracy, adoption, and community benefit.  
   - Prepare expansion & donor engagement.
